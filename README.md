Angular Pirates
====================

This web app lets you upload your favorite pirates, their hobbies, and a picture of them to a database, then view and edit your pirates.

## Features

* CRUD Functionality
* Default picture support for all pirates
* Mournful shanties upon pirate deletion
* Easy feature extension with Angular

## Motivation

This project exists to because many other pirate-based CRUD apps have failed to include the kind of modern, responsive design that today's pirate collectors expect.

## Installation

Fork or clone this repo, npm install, run gulp (the default task will create a build folder), then run mongod --dbpath with the default directory or one of your choice.

## Tests

Run tests from the terminal with gulp tests for all tests, gulp servertests for API tests, and gulp karmatests for the karma tests.

## Features for future releases

* Shanty customization from app interface
* More search filtering options
* New MongoDB resource type 

## Contributors

* David Earl Duncan
